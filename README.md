# My Project
Welcome to my repository. Here, you will find several projects that I have worked on.
These projects demonstrate my proficiency in SQL and my capacity to analyze complex data. They exhibit my abilities in data investigation, visualization, and analysis. 
# Background -  Analyzing Employee Trends
In this project, I worked with HR employee data to explore and understand trends and patterns. The data included details about employees from different departments, such as their demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, attrition rates, and more.
I used SQL to dive into the data, helping to answer important questions and uncover insights that could be helpful for decision-making.
# Tasks Performed
 - Explored and validated the HR dataset to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
 - Wrote SQL queries to analyze employee data, looking at things like department, age, education, and more to understand key patterns.
 - Identified top job roles and satisfaction levels within each department to spot departmental trends.
 - Calculated employee attrition rates by age group to identify any high-risk areas.
 - Analyzed factors that might contribute to attrition, such as age, education, and job satisfaction, to better understand what drives turnover.
 - Compared averages and other data points across different employee groups to see how they varied.
 - Identified top and bottom performers based on key metrics like satisfaction and attrition rates.
 - Used SQL techniques like JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and CASE statements to perform more detailed analysis.
 - Organized the findings into a clear and easy-to-understand format for leadership to review.
