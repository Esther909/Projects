Objective:
To analyze customer node usage across various regions, identify trends, 
and provide actionable insights to optimize node distribution and enhance customer experience.

 1. What are the number of nodes per region?
select 
      region_name,        
      count(node_id) no_of_nodes   
      from customer_nodes cn   
inner join 
      regions r      
      on cn.region_id = r.region_id  
      group by region_name  
      order by no_of_nodes desc;

2. How many customers are allocated to each region?
SELECT 
    region_name,         
    COUNT(customer_id) no_of_customers         
    FROM customer_nodes cn  
inner join 
    regions r     
    on cn.region_id = r.region_id  
    GROUP BY region_name  
    Order by no_of_customers DESC

3. What is the total amount for each transaction type?
SELECT 
   txn_type AS transaction_type, 
   SUM(txn_amount) AS total_amount 
   FROM customer_transactions  
   GROUP BY txn_type

4. What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?
SELECT        
   Count(txn_type) AS total_deposit_count,        
   sum(txn_amount) AS total_deposit_amount,       
   Count(distinct(customer_id)) AS total_deposit_customer,        
   Count(txn_type)/Count(distinct(customer_id)) as Average_deposit_count,        
   sum(txn_amount)/Count(distinct(customer_id)) as Average_deposit_Amount 
   FROM customer_transactions 
   where txn_type = 'deposit'

5. What is the total transaction amount per node?
SELECT 
   node_id,sum(txn_amount) as trans_amount
   FROM customer_transactions ct 
   inner join  customer_nodes c     
   on ct.customer_id = c.customer_id 
   GROUP BY node_id  
   order BY node_id DESC

6. What is transaction amount per region?
SELECT 
   region_id,sum(txn_amount) as trans_amount 
   FROM customer_transactions ct 
   inner join  customer_nodes c     
   on ct.customer_id = c.customer_id 
   GROUP BY region_id  
   order BY region_id DESC

7. What are the transaction amount per region and node?
SELECT 
   region_id,node_id,sum(txn_amount) as trans_amount 
   FROM customer_transactions ct 
   inner join  customer_nodes c    
   on ct.customer_id = c.customer_id 
   GROUP BY region_id,node_id 
   order BY region_id DESC
